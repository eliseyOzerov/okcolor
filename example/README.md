# OkColor Example
This Flutter project demonstrates the powerful capabilities of the OkColor package, which is based on the perceptually uniform color spaces developed by Björn Ottosson.

## Key Features
1. Gradient Generation: Showcase various methods to create smooth, perceptually uniform gradients using OkColor's advanced interpolation techniques.
2. Color Harmonies: Demonstrate the generation of color harmonies, including complementary, split-complementary, triadic, and tetradic color schemes.
3. Utility Functions: Highlight the package's utility functions for color manipulation, such as lightening, darkening, and adjusting saturation.

## Project Overview
The example application provides an interactive interface to explore:
1. Color space conversions (OkLab, OkLCH, OkHSV, RGB, HSV)
2. Smooth color transitions using different interpolation methods
3. Custom gradient creation

## Getting Started
To run the example application, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using `flutter pub get`
3. Run the application using `flutter run`

## Project Structure
