# OkColor

A Flutter package for working with colors in the Oklab color space, providing utilities for color manipulation, conversion, and analysis.

## Features

- Convert between RGB, HSV, HSL, and Oklab color spaces
- Perform color manipulations like lightening, darkening, and saturation adjustments
- Generate color palettes and gradients
- Gamut mapping and clipping functions

## Getting started

Add `okcolor` to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  okcolor: ^1.0.0
```

Then run `dart pub get` or `flutter pub get`.

## Usage

Here are some examples demonstrating how to use the OkColor package:

### Converting between color spaces

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:okcolor/okcolor.dart';

void main() {
  // Convert from Color to OkLab
  Color color = Colors.blue;
  OkLab oklab = OkLab.fromColor(color);
  // Convert from OkLab back to Color
  Color convertedColor = oklab.toColor();
  // Convert from Color to OkHsv
  OkHsv okhsv = OkHsv.fromColor(color);
}
```

### Interpolating between colors

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:okcolor/okcolor.dart';

void main() {
  Color startColor = Colors.red;
  Color endColor = Colors.blue;
  double fraction = 0.5;
  
  // Interpolate using OkLab color space
  Color interpolatedColor = interpolate(
    startColor, 
    endColor, 
    fraction,
    method: InterpolationMethod.oklab
  );

  // Interpolate using OkHSV color space
  Color interpolatedColorHSV = interpolate(
    startColor, 
    endColor, 
    fraction,
    method: InterpolationMethod.okhsv
  );
}
```
